The included files comprise HTML and CSS code for a responsive website that adjusts based on the
size of the viewport of the user. Photos and text shift from a horizontal orientation to vertical-based
to allow the website to be better viewed on mobile devices such as tablets and phones. 

The website incorporates Bootstrap framework to create a user-friendly website that includes a navbar with links to the other pages,
a grid showing various completed projects, as well as a contact form. 

When loaded on screens narrower than 576 pixels, the website responds by not only shifting to a vertical-based layout, but also 
eliminating margins to make content as large as possible for ease of use. 

On the larger page, portfolio, the website also responds to narrower viewports by hiding the footer when the screen size gets narrower than 640 pixels. This will again make the website more accessible to users on mobile devices. 

Some of the code implemented in the website was based on examples posted on css-tricks.com and https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/

Photos for the website were downloaded from wwww.pexels.com
