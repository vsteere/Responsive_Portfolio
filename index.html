                <p>I am a finance professional with six years of experience working for large 
                    government organizations including Broward County, Florida, City of Rowlett, Texas, 
                    and City of Grand Prairie, Texas. In addition to my extensive finance and budget skills 
                    I also have experience implementing ERP software solutions including Oracle PeopleSoft Finance 
                    and Planning and Budgeting Cloud Solution (PBCS). I was the subject matter expert and
                    designed both user forms and workflows as part of the PBCS implementation. During my 
                    tenure with the City of Rowlett I was the project manager and functional lead for the 
                    citywide implementaiton of the Priority Based Budgeting solution. I have extensive 
                    experience with the full software development lifecycle and both waterfall and agile
                    software implementations

                <p>During the summer of 2020 I enrolled in Southern Methodist University's web development
                    boot camp and am currently learning to design, develop, and deploy websites using the
                    Javascript MERN stack. Other items included in the boot camp include Search Engine Optimization,
